Well, starts (of virtually any kind) can be **tough**; but, hey, I made it
here (I clearly have not been postponing writing in here for a few months).
In any case, let's embark on this journey together, shall we?

In case you didn't know, from the hundred-thousand of programming tutorials,
this is how you can write a simple "Hello, Haskell" program in `Haskell`:


```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello, Haskell!"
```

Anyway, I'm merely testing the template of this website, so I had to have
something to display. Don't worry, though, much more exciting content is coming
soon.
