At this __subdomain__, I plan to post about my take on Functional Programming. Recently, I've emerged myself into this __paradigm__ and I've grew thoroughly fond of it. Therefore, I want to share my thoughts and ideas about it, as well as my own implementations of some of the most popular __algorithms__ and __data structures__ – to show, that __FP__ is not only about __pure functions__ and __immutable data__ – it's also about another way of thinking and approaching problems.
