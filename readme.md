I plan to post about my take on Functional Programming on this subdomain. I've
emerged myself into this __paradigm__ and I grew thoroughly fond of it.
Therefore, I want to share my thoughts and ideas about it, as well as my own
implementations of some of the most popular __algorithms__, __data
structures__, and so forth -- to show, that __FP__ is not only about __pure
functions__ and __immutable data__ â€“ it's also about another way of thinking
and approaching problems.
